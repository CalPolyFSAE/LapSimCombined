These equations of based of curve fits of Hoosier R25B 13x7 tire data.
 * Fit is based on tire normal loads from 0-350lbs and is only an
   extrapolation beyond that.
 * Optimum Slip Angles/Ratios were used to find the ouput force and are
   returned. Returned Slip Angle may be inaccurate at normal loads < 50 lbs.
 * An Inclination Angle of 0 was also used.
